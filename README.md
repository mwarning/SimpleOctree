# Simple Octree

WARNING: There is currently a bug present that needs to be fixed (#1)!

A simple and very fast Octree implementation that supports Nearest Neigbour Search.
The code uses a pool allocator, but it is easy to swap it out for malloc/free.

The code is licensed under CC0 / released into Public Domain.
